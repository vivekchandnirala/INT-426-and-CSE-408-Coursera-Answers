
Question 1
What is the tightest estimate you can prove on the memory consumption of a trie built off n non-empty patterns p1,p2,.....,pn if all the patterns' lengths are bounded from above by L, and the sum of lengths of all patterns is no more than S ?

Answer:-
O(S)


Question 2
What is the time complexity of searching all occurrences of n patterns p1,p2,....,pn in text T of length |T| if all patterns have length at most L and the sum of their lengths is at most S?

Answer:-
O(|T|L)



Question 3
What is the smallest possible number of nodes in a trie built off n patterns p1,p2,....,pn if all the patterns have the same length L > 0 ?

Answer:-
L + 1


Question 4
If you take all the suffixes of a string S of length L and build a regular trie off those suffixes as patterns, what is the maximum possible number of nodes in such trie?

Answer:-
  L(L+1) / 2  + 1


Question 5
What is the smallest possible number of nodes in a suffix tree of string S with length L?

Answer:-
L+1
